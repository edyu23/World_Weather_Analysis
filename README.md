World Weather Analysis

## **Overview of Project**
We are making an app called PlanMyTrip. We start with generating 2000 random latitudes and longitudes to get at least 500 cities we can work with to generate a weather database. We will then get travel destinations based on certain parameters like weather. Lastly we will also make an vacation itinerary based on the available travel destinations based on our parameters.

## Results
We successfully generated random latitude and longitudes to get several hundred workable travel destinations as illustrated by our WeatherPy_vacation_map.

I also made a vacation itinerary based in the United States as illustrated below.

## Summary
The PlanMyTrip is useful and can be tailored to meet certain travel criteria for interested travelers. I can't help but think that this can be expanded since I love to travel to add other factors which I hope to gain more technical skills as I proceed through this course.
